// Most functions within this file exist to provide a consistent interface for our templated tests.
// Function overloading is used to select between the float, double, rocblas_float_complex
// and rocblas_double_complex variants, and to distinguish the batched case (T**) from the normal
// and strided_batched cases (T*).
//
// The normal and strided_batched cases are distinguished from each other by passing a boolean
// parameter, STRIDED. Variants such as the blocked and unblocked versions of algorithms, may be
// provided in similar ways.
