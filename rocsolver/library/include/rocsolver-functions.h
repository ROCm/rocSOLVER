    \brief LARFB applies a block reflector H to a general m-by-n matrix A.

    \details
    The block reflector H is applied in one of the following forms, depending on
    the values of side and trans:

        H  * A  (No transpose from the left)
        H' * A  (Transpose or conjugate transpose from the left)
        A * H   (No transpose from the right), and
        A * H'  (Transpose or conjugate transpose from the right)

    The block reflector H is defined as the product of k Householder matrices as

        H = H(1) * H(2) * ... * H(k)  (forward direction), or
        H = H(k) * ... * H(2) * H(1)  (backward direction)

    depending on the value of direct. H is never stored. It is calculated as

        H = I - V * T * V'

    where the i-th column of matrix V contains the Householder vector associated with H(i), if storev is column-wise; or

        H = I - V' * T * V

    where the i-th row of matrix V contains the Householder vector associated with H(i), if storev is row-wise.
    T is the associated triangular factor as computed by LARFT.

    \brief LABRD computes the bidiagonal form of the first k rows and columns of
    a general m-by-n matrix A, as well as the matrices X and Y needed to reduce
    the remaining part of A.

    \details
    The bidiagonal form is given by:

        B = Q' * A * P

    where B is upper bidiagonal if m >= n and lower bidiagonal if m < n, and Q and
    P are orthogonal/unitary matrices represented as the product of Householder matrices

        Q = H(1) * H(2) * ... *  H(k)  and P = G(1) * G(2) * ... * G(k-1), if m >= n, or
        Q = H(1) * H(2) * ... * H(k-1) and P = G(1) * G(2) * ... *  G(k),  if m < n

    Each Householder matrix H(i) and G(i) is given by

        H(i) = I - tauq[i-1] * v(i) * v(i)', and
        G(i) = I - taup[i-1] * u(i) * u(i)'

    If m >= n, the first i-1 elements of the Householder vector v(i) are zero, and v(i)[i] = 1;
    while the first i elements of the Householder vector u(i) are zero, and u(i)[i+1] = 1.
    If m < n, the first i elements of the Householder vector v(i) are zero, and v(i)[i+1] = 1;
    while the first i-1 elements of the Householder vector u(i) are zero, and u(i)[i] = 1.

    The unreduced part of the matrix A can be updated using a block update:

        A = A - V * Y' - X * U'

    where V is an m-by-k matrix and U is an n-by-k formed using the vectors v and u.

    \brief LATRD computes the tridiagonal form of k rows and columns of
    a symmetric/hermitian matrix A, as well as the matrix W needed to update
    the remaining part of A.

    \details
    The reduced form is given by:

        T = Q' * A * Q

    If uplo is lower, the first k rows and columns of T form a tridiagonal block, if uplo is upper, then the last
    k rows and columns of T form the tridiagonal block. Q is an orthogonal/unitary matrix represented as the
    product of Householder matrices

        Q = H(1) * H(2) * ... *  H(k)  if uplo indicates lower, or
        Q = H(n-1) * H(n-2) * ... * H(n-k) if uplo is upper.

    Each Householder matrix H(i) is given by

        H(i) = I - tau[i] * v(i) * v(i)'

    where tau[i] is the corresponding Householder scalar. When uplo indicates lower, the first i
    elements of the Householder vector v(i) are zero, and v(i)[i+1] = 1. If uplo is upper,
    the last n-i elements of the Householder vector v(i) are zero, and v(i)[i] = 1.

    The unreduced part of the matrix A can be updated using a rank update of the form:

        A = A - V * W' - W * V'

    where V is an n-by-k matrix formed by the vectors v(i).

              (given in the diagonal elements of A and the array E), the elements below the diagonal
              contain the vectors v(i) stored as columns.
              If uplo is upper, the last k columns have been reduced to tridiagonal form
              (given in the diagonal elements of A and the array E), the elements above the diagonal

    \brief ORMQL applies a matrix Q with orthonormal columns to a general m-by-n
    matrix C.

    The matrix Q is applied in one of the following forms, depending on
    the values of side and trans:

    Q is an orthogonal matrix defined as the product of k Householder reflectors
    as

        Q = H(k) * H(k-1) * ... * H(1)

    of order m if applying from the left, or n if applying from the right. Q is

    \brief UNMBR applies a complex matrix Q with orthonormal rows or columns to
    a general m-by-n matrix C.

    \details
    If storev is column-wise, then the matrix Q has orthonormal columns.
    If storev is row-wise, then the matrix Q has orthonormal rows.
    The matrix Q is applied in one of the following forms, depending on
    the values of side and trans:

        Q  * C  (No transpose from the left)
        Q' * C  (Conjugate transpose from the left)
        C * Q   (No transpose from the right), and
        C * Q'  (Conjugate transpose from the right)

    The order nq of unitary matrix Q is nq = m if applying from the left, or nq = n if applying from the right.

    When storev is column-wise, if nq >= k, then Q is defined as the product of k Householder reflectors of order nq

        Q = H(1) * H(2) * ... * H(k),

    and if nq < k, then Q is defined as the product

        Q = H(1) * H(2) * ... * H(nq-1).

    When storev is row-wise, if nq > k, then Q is defined as the product of k Householder reflectors of order nq

        Q = H(1) * H(2) * ... * H(k),

    and if n <= k, Q is defined as the product

        Q = H(1) * H(2) * ... * H(nq-1)

    The Householder matrices H(i) are never stored, they are computed from its corresponding
    Householder vectors v(i) and scalars ipiv_i as returned by GEBRD in its arguments A and tauq or taup.

    \brief BDSQR computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a
    n-by-n bidiagonal matrix B.

    \details
    The SVD of B has the form:

        B = Ub * S * Vb'

    where S is the n-by-n diagonal matrix of singular values of B, the columns of Ub are the left
    singular vectors of B, and the columns of Vb are its right singular vectors.

    The computation of the singular vectors is optional; this function accepts input matrices
    U (of size nu-by-n) and V (of size n-by-nv) that are overwritten with U*Ub and Vb'*V. If nu = 0
    no left vectors are computed; if nv = 0 no right vectors are computed.

    Optionally, this function can also compute Ub'*C for a given n-by-nc input matrix C.

    could be executed with small and mid-size matrices if optimizations are enabled (default option). For more details see the

    The factorization has the form

    where L is lower triangular with unit
    diagonal elements (lower trapezoidal if m > n), and U is upper
    triangular (upper trapezoidal if m < n).

    If numerical accuracy is compromised, use the legacy-LAPACK-like API GETF2 routines instead.

    \brief GETRF_STRIDED_BATCHED computes the LU factorization of a batch of

    (This is the blocked Level-3-BLAS version of the algorithm. An optimized internal implementation without rocBLAS calls
    could be executed with mid-size matrices if optimizations are enabled (default option). For more details see the
    section "tuning rocSOLVER performance" on the User's guide).

    The factorization of matrix A_i in the batch has the form

        A_i = P_i * L_i * U_i

    where P_i is a permutation matrix, L_i is lower triangular with unit
    diagonal elements (lower trapezoidal if m > n), and U_i is upper
    triangular (upper trapezoidal if m < n).

              Dimension of ipiv_i is min(m,n).

    Each Householder matrices H_j(i), for j = 1,2,...,batch_count, and i = 1,2,...,k, is given by

        H_j(i) = I - ipiv_j[i-1] * v_j(i) * v_j(i)'

    \brief GEBD2 computes the bidiagonal form of a general m-by-n matrix A.

    \details
    (This is the unblocked version of the algorithm).

    The bidiagonal form is given by:

        B = Q' * A * P

    where B is upper bidiagonal if m >= n and lower bidiagonal if m < n, and Q and
    P are orthogonal/unitary matrices represented as the product of Householder matrices

        Q = H(1) * H(2) * ... *  H(n)  and P = G(1) * G(2) * ... * G(n-1), if m >= n, or
        Q = H(1) * H(2) * ... * H(m-1) and P = G(1) * G(2) * ... *  G(m),  if m < n

    Each Householder matrix H(i) and G(i) is given by

        H(i) = I - tauq[i-1] * v(i) * v(i)', and
        G(i) = I - taup[i-1] * u(i) * u(i)'

    If m >= n, the first i-1 elements of the Householder vector v(i) are zero, and v(i)[i] = 1;
    while the first i elements of the Householder vector u(i) are zero, and u(i)[i+1] = 1.
    If m < n, the first i elements of the Householder vector v(i) are zero, and v(i)[i+1] = 1;
    while the first i-1 elements of the Householder vector u(i) are zero, and u(i)[i] = 1.

    \brief GEBD2_STRIDED_BATCHED computes the bidiagonal form of a batch of
    general m-by-n matrices.

    \details
    (This is the unblocked version of the algorithm).

    The bidiagonal form is given by:

        B_j = Q_j' * A_j * P_j

    where B_j is upper bidiagonal if m >= n and lower bidiagonal if m < n, and Q_j and
    P_j are orthogonal/unitary matrices represented as the product of Householder matrices

        Q_j = H_j(1) * H_j(2) * ... *  H_j(n)  and P_j = G_j(1) * G_j(2) * ... * G_j(n-1), if m >= n, or
        Q_j = H_j(1) * H_j(2) * ... * H_j(m-1) and P_j = G_j(1) * G_j(2) * ... *  G_j(m),  if m < n

    Each Householder matrix H_j(i) and G_j(i), for j = 1,2,...,batch_count, is given by

        H_j(i) = I - tauq_j[i-1] * v_j(i) * v_j(i)', and
        G_j(i) = I - taup_j[i-1] * u_j(i) * u_j(i)'

    If m >= n, the first i-1 elements of the Householder vector v_j(i) are zero, and v_j(i)[i] = 1;
    while the first i elements of the Householder vector u_j(i) are zero, and u_j(i)[i+1] = 1.
    If m < n, the first i elements of the Householder vector v_j(i) are zero, and v_j(i)[i+1] = 1;
    while the first i-1 elements of the Householder vector u_j(i) are zero, and u_j(i)[i] = 1.

    \brief GEBRD_BATCHED computes the bidiagonal form of a batch of general
    m-by-n matrices.

    \details
    (This is the blocked version of the algorithm).

    The bidiagonal form is given by:

        B_j = Q_j' * A_j * P_j

    where B_j is upper bidiagonal if m >= n and lower bidiagonal if m < n, and Q_j and
    P_j are orthogonal/unitary matrices represented as the product of Householder matrices

        Q_j = H_j(1) * H_j(2) * ... *  H_j(n)  and P_j = G_j(1) * G_j(2) * ... * G_j(n-1), if m >= n, or
        Q_j = H_j(1) * H_j(2) * ... * H_j(m-1) and P_j = G_j(1) * G_j(2) * ... *  G_j(m),  if m < n

    Each Householder matrix H_j(i) and G_j(i), for j = 1,2,...,batch_count, is given by

        H_j(i) = I - tauq_j[i-1] * v_j(i) * v_j(i)', and
        G_j(i) = I - taup_j[i-1] * u_j(i) * u_j(i)'

    If m >= n, the first i-1 elements of the Householder vector v_j(i) are zero, and v_j(i)[i] = 1;
    while the first i elements of the Householder vector u_j(i) are zero, and u_j(i)[i+1] = 1.
    If m < n, the first i elements of the Householder vector v_j(i) are zero, and v_j(i)[i+1] = 1;
    while the first i-1 elements of the Householder vector u_j(i) are zero, and u_j(i)[i] = 1.

              superdiagonal are the n - i - 1 elements of vector u_j(i) for i = 1,2,...,n-1.
              If m < n, the elements below the subdiagonal are the m - i - 1
              elements of vector v_j(i) for i = 1,2,...,m-1, and the elements above the
              diagonal are the n - i elements of vector u_j(i) for i = 1,2,...,m.

    \brief GEBRD_STRIDED_BATCHED computes the bidiagonal form of a batch of
    general m-by-n matrices.

    \details
    (This is the blocked version of the algorithm).

    The bidiagonal form is given by:

        B_j = Q_j' * A_j * P_j

    where B_j is upper bidiagonal if m >= n and lower bidiagonal if m < n, and Q_j and
    P_j are orthogonal/unitary matrices represented as the product of Householder matrices

        Q_j = H_j(1) * H_j(2) * ... *  H_j(n)  and P_j = G_j(1) * G_j(2) * ... * G_j(n-1), if m >= n, or
        Q_j = H_j(1) * H_j(2) * ... * H_j(m-1) and P_j = G_j(1) * G_j(2) * ... *  G_j(m),  if m < n

    Each Householder matrix H_j(i) and G_j(i), for j = 1,2,...,batch_count, is given by

        H_j(i) = I - tauq_j[i-1] * v_j(i) * v_j(i)', and
        G_j(i) = I - taup_j[i-1] * u_j(i) * u_j(i)'

    If m >= n, the first i-1 elements of the Householder vector v_j(i) are zero, and v_j(i)[i] = 1;
    while the first i elements of the Householder vector u_j(i) are zero, and u_j(i)[i+1] = 1.
    If m < n, the first i elements of the Householder vector v_j(i) are zero, and v_j(i)[i+1] = 1;
    while the first i-1 elements of the Householder vector u_j(i) are zero, and u_j(i)[i] = 1.

              superdiagonal are the n - i - 1 elements of vector u_j(i) for i = 1,2,...,n-1.
              If m < n, the elements below the subdiagonal are the m - i - 1
              elements of vector v_j(i) for i = 1,2,...,m-1, and the elements above the

    \brief GELS solves an overdetermined (or underdetermined) linear system defined by an m-by-n
    matrix A, and a corresponding matrix B, using the QR factorization computed by GEQRF (or the LQ
    factorization computed by GELQF).

    \details
    The problem solved by this function is either of the form

        A  * X = B (no transpose), or
        A' * X = B (transpose/conjugate transpose)

    depending on the value of trans.

    If m >= n (or n < m in the case of transpose/conjugate transpose), the system is overdetermined
    and a least-squares solution approximating X is found minimizing

        || B - A  * X || (no transpose), or
        || B - A' * X || (transpose/conjugate transpose)

    If n < m (or m >= n in the case of transpose/conjugate transpose), the system is underdetermined
    and a unique solution for X is chosen minimizing || X ||

    \note
    The current implementation only supports the overdetermined, no transpose case.
    \p rocblas_status_not_implemented will be returned if m < n, or if trans is
    \p rocblas_operation_transpose or \p rocblas_operation_conjugate_transpose.

              If info = 0, successful exit.
              If info = j > 0, the solution could not be computed because input matrix A is 
              rank deficient; the j-th diagonal element of its triangular factor is zero.

    \brief GELS_STRIDED_BATCHED solves batches of overdetermined (or underdetermined) linear
    systems defined by the array of m-by-n matrices A, and an array of corresponding matrices B,
    using the QR factorizations computed by GEQRF (or the LQ factorizations computed by GELQF).

    \details
    The problem solved by this function is either of the form

        A_i  * X_i = B_i (no transpose), or
        A_i' * X_i = B_i (transpose/conjugate transpose)

    depending on the value of trans.

    If m >= n (or n < m in the case of transpose/conjugate transpose), the systems are
    overdetermined and least-squares solutions approximating X_i are found minimizing

        || B_i - A_i  * X_i || (no transpose), or
        || B_i - A_i' * X_i || (transpose/conjugate transpose)

    If n < m (or m >= n in the case of transpose/conjugate transpose), the system is
    underdetermined and a unique solution for X_i is chosen minimizing || X_i ||

    \note
    The current implementation only supports the overdetermined, no transpose case.
    \p rocblas_status_not_implemented will be returned if m < n, or if trans is
    \p rocblas_operation_transpose or \p rocblas_operation_conjugate_transpose.

    \brief GESVD computes the Singular Values and optionally the Singular
    Vectors of a general m-by-n matrix A (Singular Value Decomposition).

    \details
    The SVD of matrix A is given by:

        A = U * S * V'

    where the m-by-n matrix S is zero except, possibly, for its min(m,n)
    diagonal elements, which are the singular values of A. U and V are orthogonal
    (unitary) matrices. The first min(m,n) columns of U and V are the left and
    right singular vectors of A, respectively.

    The computation of the singular vectors is optional and it is controlled by
    the function arguments left_svect and right_svect as described below. When
    computed, this function returns the transpose (or transpose conjugate) of the
    right singular vectors, i.e. the rows of V'.

    left_svect and right_svect are #rocblas_svect enums that can take the
    following values:

    - rocblas_svect_all: the entire matrix U (or V') is computed,
    - rocblas_svect_singular: only the singular vectors (first min(m,n)
      columns of U or rows of V') are computed,
    - rocblas_svect_overwrite: the first
      columns (or rows) of A are overwritten with the singular vectors, or
    - rocblas_svect_none: no columns (or rows) of U (or V') are computed, i.e.
      no singular vectors.

    left_svect and right_svect cannot both be set to overwrite. When neither is
    set to overwrite, the contents of A are destroyed by the time the function
    returns.

   \note
    When m >> n (or n >> m) the algorithm could be sped up by compressing
    the matrix A via a QR (or LQ) factorization, and working with the triangular
    factor afterwards (thin-SVD). If the singular vectors are also requested, its
    computation could be sped up as well via executing some intermediate
    operations out-of-place, and relying more on matrix multiplications (GEMMs);
    this will require, however, a larger memory workspace. The parameter fast_alg
    controls whether the fast algorithm is executed or not. For more details see
    the sections "Tuning rocSOLVER performance" and "Memory model" on the User's
    guide.

    \brief GESVD_BATCHED computes the Singular Values and optionally the
    Singular Vectors of a batch of general m-by-n matrix A (Singular Value
    Decomposition).

    \details
    The SVD of matrix A_j is given by:

        A_j = U_j * S_j * V_j'

    where the m-by-n matrix S_j is zero except, possibly, for its min(m,n)
    diagonal elements, which are the singular values of A_j. U_j and V_j are
    orthogonal (unitary) matrices. The first min(m,n) columns of U_j and V_j are
    the left and right singular vectors of A_j, respectively.

    The computation of the singular vectors is optional and it is controlled by
    the function arguments left_svect and right_svect as described below. When
    computed, this function returns the transpose (or transpose conjugate) of the
    right singular vectors, i.e. the rows of V_j'.

    left_svect and right_svect are #rocblas_svect enums that can take the
    following values:

    - rocblas_svect_all: the entire matrix U_j (or V_j') is computed,
    - rocblas_svect_singular: only the singular vectors (first min(m,n)
      columns of U_j or rows of V_j') are computed,
    - rocblas_svect_overwrite: the
      first columns (or rows) of A_j are overwritten with the singular vectors, or
    - rocblas_svect_none: no columns (or rows) of U_j (or V_j') are computed,
      i.e. no singular vectors.

    left_svect and right_svect cannot both be set to overwrite. When neither is
    set to overwrite, the contents of A_j are destroyed by the time the function
    returns.

    \note
    When m >> n (or n >> m) the algorithm could be sped up by compressing
    the matrix A_j via a QR (or LQ) factorization, and working with the
    triangular factor afterwards (thin-SVD). If the singular vectors are also
    requested, its computation could be sped up as well via executing some
    intermediate operations out-of-place, and relying more on matrix
    multiplications (GEMMs); this will require, however, a larger memory
    workspace. The parameter fast_alg controls whether the fast algorithm is
    executed or not. For more details see the sections
    "Tuning rocSOLVER performance" and "Memory model" on the User's guide.

                the first columns (or rows) of A_j contain the left (or right)
                corresponding singular vectors; otherwise, contents of A_j are destroyed.

                Normal use case is strideU >= ldu*min(m,n) if left_svect is set to singular,

                On exit, if info > 0, it contains the unconverged off-diagonal elements of B_j (or properly speaking,
                a bidiagonal matrix orthogonally equivalent to B_j). The diagonal elements of this matrix are in S_j;
                those that converged correspond to a subset of the singular values of A_j (not necessarily ordered).

    \brief GESVD_STRIDED_BATCHED computes the Singular Values and optionally the
    Singular Vectors of a batch of general m-by-n matrix A (Singular Value
    Decomposition).

    \details
    The SVD of matrix A_j is given by:

        A_j = U_j * S_j * V_j'

    where the m-by-n matrix S_j is zero except, possibly, for its min(m,n)
    diagonal elements, which are the singular values of A_j. U_j and V_j are
    orthogonal (unitary) matrices. The first min(m,n) columns of U_j and V_j are
    the left and right singular vectors of A_j, respectively.

    The computation of the singular vectors is optional and it is controlled by
    the function arguments left_svect and right_svect as described below. When
    computed, this function returns the transpose (or transpose conjugate) of the
    right singular vectors, i.e. the rows of V_j'.

    left_svect and right_svect are #rocblas_svect enums that can take the
    following values:

    - rocblas_svect_all: the entire matrix U_j (or V_j') is computed,
    - rocblas_svect_singular: only the singular vectors (first min(m,n) columns
      of U_j or rows of V_j') are computed,
    - rocblas_svect_overwrite: the first columns (or rows) of
      A_j are overwritten with the singular vectors, or
    - rocblas_svect_none: no columns (or rows) of U_j (or V_j')
      are computed, i.e. no singular vectors.

    left_svect and right_svect cannot both be set to overwrite. When neither is
    set to overwrite, the contents of A_j are destroyed by the time the function
    returns.

    \note
    When m >> n (or n >> m) the algorithm could be sped up by compressing
    the matrix A_j via a QR (or LQ) factorization, and working with the
    triangular factor afterwards (thin-SVD). If the singular vectors are also
    requested, its computation could be sped up as well via executing some
    intermediate operations out-of-place, and relying more on matrix
    multiplications (GEMMs); this will require, however, a larger memory
    workspace. The parameter fast_alg controls whether the fast algorithm is
    executed or not. For more details see the sections
    "Tuning rocSOLVER performance" and "Memory model" on the User's guide.

                There is no restriction for the value of strideU.
                Normal use case is strideU >= ldu*min(m,n) if left_svect is set to singular,
                or strideU >= ldu*m when left_svect is equal to all.

    E           pointer to real type. Array on the GPU (the size depends on the value of strideE).\n
                This array is used to work internally with the bidiagonal matrix B_j associated to A_j (using BDSQR).
                On exit, if info > 0, it contains the unconverged off-diagonal elements of B_j (or properly speaking,
                a bidiagonal matrix orthogonally equivalent to B_j). The diagonal elements of this matrix are in S_j;
                those that converged correspond to a subset of the singular values of A_j (not necessarily ordered).
    @param[in]

                Stride from the start of one vector E_j to the next one E_(j+1).
                There is no restriction for the value of strideE.
                Normal use case is strideE >= min(m,n)-1.
    @param[in]
    fast_alg    #rocblas_workmode. \n
                If set to rocblas_outofplace, the function will execute the fast thin-SVD version
                of the algorithm when possible.

                If info = 0, successful exit.
                If info = i > 0, BDSQR did not converge. i elements of E did not converge to zero.

                Number of matrices in the batch.

    Each Householder matrix H_j(i) is given by

    The tridiagonal form of A_j is given by:

        T_j = Q_j' * A_j * Q_j, for j = 1,2,...,batch_count

    where T_j is hermitian tridiagonal and Q_j is a unitary  matrix represented as the product
    of Householder matrices

        Q_j = H_j(1) * H_j(2) * ... *  H_j(n-1) if uplo indicates lower, or
        Q_j = H_j(n-1) * H_j(n-2) * ... * H_j(1) if uplo indicates upper.

    Each Householder matrix H_j(i) is given by

        H_j(i) = I - tau_j[i] * v_j(i) * v_j(i)'

    where tau_j[i] is the corresponding Householder scalar. When uplo indicates lower, the first i
    elements of the Householder vector v_j(i) are zero, and v_j(i)[i+1] = 1. If uplo indicates upper,
    the last n-i elements of the Householder vector v_j(i) are zero, and v_j(i)[i] = 1.

    The tridiagonal form of A_j is given by:

    Each Householder matrix H_j(i) is given by

        H_j(i) = I - tau_j[i] * v_j(i) * v_j(i)'

    where tau_j[i] is the corresponding Householder scalar. When uplo indicates lower, the first i
    elements of the Householder vector v_j(i) are zero, and v_j(i)[i+1] = 1. If uplo indicates upper,

    \brief HETRD_STRIDED_BATCHED computes the tridiagonal form of a batch of complex hermitian matrices A_j.

    \details
    (This is the blocked version of the algorithm).

    The tridiagonal form of A_j is given by:

        T_j = Q_j' * A_j * Q_j, for j = 1,2,...,batch_count

    where T_j is hermitian tridiagonal and Q_j is a unitary  matrix represented as the product
    of Householder matrices

        Q_j = H_j(1) * H_j(2) * ... *  H_j(n-1) if uplo indicates lower, or
        Q_j = H_j(n-1) * H_j(n-2) * ... * H_j(1) if uplo indicates upper.

    Each Householder matrix H_j(i) is given by

        H_j(i) = I - tau_j[i] * v_j(i) * v_j(i)'

    where tau_j[i] is the corresponding Householder scalar. When uplo indicates lower, the first i
    elements of the Householder vector v_j(i) are zero, and v_j(i)[i+1] = 1. If uplo indicates upper,
    the last n-i elements of the Householder vector v_j(i) are zero, and v_j(i)[i] = 1.

    @param[in]
    handle    rocblas_handle.
    @param[in]
    uplo      rocblas_fill.\n
              Specifies whether the upper or lower part of the hermitian matrix A_j is stored.
              If uplo indicates lower (or upper), then the upper (or lower)
              part of A is not used.
    @param[in]
    n         rocblas_int. n >= 0.\n
              The number of rows and columns of the matrices A_j.
    @param[inout]
    A         pointer to type. Array on the GPU (the size depends on the value of strideA).\n
              On entry, the matrices A_j to be factored.
              On exit, if upper, then the elements on the diagonal and superdiagonal of A_j
              contain the tridiagonal form T_j; the elements above the superdiagonal contain
              the i-1 non-zero elements of vectors v_j(i) stored as columns.
              If lower, then the elements on the diagonal and subdiagonal
              contain the tridiagonal form T_j; the elements below the subdiagonal contain
              the n-i-1 non-zero elements of vectors v_j(i) stored as columns.
    @param[in]
    lda       rocblas_int. lda >= n.\n
              specifies the leading dimension of A_j.
    @param[in]
    strideA   rocblas_stride.\n
              Stride from the start of one matrix A_j and the next one A_(j+1).
              There is no restriction for the value of strideA. Normal use case is strideA >= lda*n.
    @param[out]
    D         pointer to real type. Array on the GPU (the size depends on the value of strideD).\n
              The diagonal elements of T_j.
    @param[in]
    strideD   rocblas_stride.\n
              Stride from the start of one vector D_j and the next one D_(j+1).
              There is no restriction for the value of strideD. Normal use case is strideD >= n.
    @param[out]
    E         pointer to real type. Array on the GPU (the size depends on the value of strideE).\n
              The off-diagonal elements of T_j.
    @param[in]
    strideE   rocblas_stride.\n
              Stride from the start of one vector E_j and the next one E_(j+1).
              There is no restriction for the value of strideE. Normal use case is strideE >= n-1.
    @param[out]
    tau       pointer to type. Array on the GPU (the size depends on the value of strideP).\n
              Contains the vectors tau_j of scalar factors of the
              Householder matrices H_j(i).
    @param[in]
    strideP   rocblas_stride.\n
              Stride from the start of one vector tau_j to the next one tau_(j+1).
              There is no restriction for the value
              of strideP. Normal use is strideP >= n-1.
    @param[in]
    batch_count  rocblas_int. batch_count >= 0.\n
                 Number of matrices in the batch.
