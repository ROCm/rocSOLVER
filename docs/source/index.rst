**Contents**

rocSOLVER's documentation consists of three main chapters. The :doc:`User Guide <userguide_index>`
is the starting point for new users of the library and a basic reference for current rocSOLVER or
LAPACK users. The :doc:`Library Design Guide <design_index>` describes rocSOLVER for advanced
users and developers who want to further understand or extend the library. Finally, the
