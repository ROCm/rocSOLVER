Benchmarking rocSOLVER
==================================

.. toctree::

``rocsolver-bench`` runs any rocSOLVER function with random data of the specified dimensions; it compares the computed results, and provides basic
performance information (as for now, execution times).

Similarly,

.. code-block:: bash

    ./rocsolver-bench --help

returns information on how to use the rocSOLVER benchmark client.
