Installing from pre-built packages
====================================

.. toctree::

If you have added the ROCm repositories to your Linux distribution, the latest release version of
rocSOLVER can be installed using a package manager. On Ubuntu, for example, use the commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install rocsolver
